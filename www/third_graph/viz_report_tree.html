    <h3>Timestamp</h3>
    <p>The data used was based on the production of energy in 2021, the latest year available. However, the dataset offers energy data from 1990.</p>

        
    
    <h3>Data source</h3>
    <p>The source used was data from the ‘Energy Datasheets’ in the European Commission website. It has data about the energy production of many countries, with additional information about the type of energy, such as heat, electricity, and nuclear energy. It also contained more interesting data about greenhouse gas emissions</p>

    <h3>Actions Performed</h3>
    <ol> 
    <li>Export the dataset as a CSV file.</li>   
    <li>Load it in a data frame using pandas (Python library).</li>
    <li>Deleted the first two sheets, as they weren’t relevant to the question.</li>
    <li>Retrieved useful rows of every other page and merged them together into a single dataset, specifying those taken during 2021.</li>
    <li>Re-organized the data frame to have one country per row and the types of energy in the columns.</li>
    <li>Saved the data frame in a CSV file.</li>
    <li>Loaded it on Flourish as data of a ‘Tree Map’.</li>
    <li>Matched the graph parameters to the columns, with the rectangles size representing the value of energy in.</li>
    <li>Added a drop-down menu filter to choose a specific country.</li>
    <li>Made additional changes such as color, characters, and popups changes.</li>
