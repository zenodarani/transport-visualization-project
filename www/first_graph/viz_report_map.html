    <h3>Actions Performed</h3>
    <ol> 
    <li>Export the dataset as a CSV file.</li>   
    <li>Load it in a data frame using pandas (Python library).</li>
    <li>Selected only the rows that were associated with the TOTAL sector, since we weren’t interested in any specific sector of those provided.</li>
    <li>Dropped not useful columns.</li>
    <li>Saved the data frame as a CSV file.</li>
    <li>Loaded it on Flourish as data of a ‘Connections Globe’.</li>
    <li>Matched the graph parameters to the columns. We used two filters: the first one as a drop-down menu that allows one to decide which connection flow to project; the second being the years, thus enabling the animation.</li>
    <li>Made small changes and corrections to make the visualization more appealing and suited to our project. These included modifications on the size and color of the arrows, the initial zoom-in and rotation, and size of the graph.</li>
