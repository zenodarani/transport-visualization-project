    <h3>Actions Performed</h3>
    <ol> 
    <li>Export the dataset as a CSV file.</li>   
    <li>Load it in a data frame using pandas (Python library).</li>
    <li>Selected only the rows that were associated with the TOTAL sector, since we weren’t interested in any specific sector of those provided.</li>
    <li>Dropped not useful columns.</li>
    <li>Searched online for the URL of the country flags and added a column to contain them.</li>
    <li>Split the dataframe into two, one for the imports and one for the exports, then saved them in their respective CSV files.</li>
    <li>Loaded it on Flourish as data of a ‘Bar Chart Race’.</li>
    <li>Matched the graph parameters to the columns. The animation based on the year, the y-axis describing the country by its name and flag.</li>
    <li>Added a line plot below to show additional trend insights. It also works as an intuitive way to move the graph on the timeline.</li>
